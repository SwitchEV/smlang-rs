> A state machine language DSL based on the syntax of [Boost-SML](https://boost-ext.github.io/sml/).

## Aim

The aim of this DSL is to facilitate the use of state machines, as they quite fast can become overly complicated to write and get an overview of.

## Transition DSL

The DSL is defined as follows:

```rust
statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        *SrcState1 + Event1 [ guard1 ] / action1 = DstState2, // * denotes starting state
        SrcState2 + Event2 [ guard2 ] / action2 = DstState1,
    }
    // ...
}
```

Where `guard` and `action` are optional and can be left out. A `guard` is a function which returns `true` if the state transition should happen, and `false`  if the transition should not happen, while `action` are functions that are run during the transition which are guaranteed to finish before entering the new state.

> This implies that any state machine must be written as a list of transitions.

The DSL supports wildcards and pattern matching for input states similar to rust pattern matching:

```rust
statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        *State1 | State3 + ToState2 = State2,
        State1 | State2 + ToState3 = State3,
        _ + ToState4 = State4,
        State4 + ToState1 = State1,
    }
    // ...
}
```

Which is equivalent to:

```rust
statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        *State1 + ToState2 = State2,
        State3 + ToState2 = State2,

        State1 + ToState3 = State3,
        State2 + ToState3 = State3,

        State1 + ToState4 = State4,
        State2 + ToState4 = State4,
        State3 + ToState4 = State4,
        State4 + ToState4 = State4,

        State4 + ToState1 = State1,
    }
    // ...
}
```

See example `examples/input_state_pattern_match.rs` for a usage example.

### State machine context

The state machine needs a context to be defined.
The `StateMachineContext` is generated from the `statemachine!` proc-macro and is what implements guards and actions, and data that is available in all states within the state machine and persists between state transitions:

```rust
statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        State1 + Event1 = State2,
    }
    // ...
}

pub struct Context;

impl StateMachineContext for Context {}

fn main() {
    let mut sm = StateMachine::new(Context);

    // ...
}
```

See example `examples/context.rs` for a usage example.

### State data

Any state may have some data associated with it:

```rust
pub struct MyStateData(pub u32);

statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        State1(MyStateData) + Event1 = State2,
    }
    // ...
}
```

See example `examples/state_with_data.rs` for a usage example.

If the starting state contains data, this data must be provided after the context when creating a new machine.

```rust
pub struct MyStateData(pub u32);

statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        State2 + Event2 / action = State1(MyStateData),
        *State1(MyStateData) + Event1 = State2,
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}

// ...

let mut sm = StateMachine::new(Context, MyStateData(42));
```

State data may also have associated lifetimes which the `statemachine!` macro will pick up and add the `States` enum and `StateMachine` structure. This means the following will also work:

```rust
pub struct MyStateData<'a>(&'a u32);

statemachine! {
    transitions: {
        *State1 + Event1 / action = State2,
        State2(MyStateData<'a>) + Event2 = State1,
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

See example `examples/state_with_reference_data.rs` for a usage example.

### Event data

Data may be passed along with an event into the `guard` and `action`:

```rust
pub struct MyEventData(pub u32);

statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        State1 + Event1(MyEventData) [guard] = State2,
    }
    // ...
}
```

Event data may also have associated lifetimes which the `statemachine!` macro will pick up and add the `Events` enum. This means the following will also work:

```rust
pub struct MyEventData<'a>(pub &'a u32);

statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        State1 + Event1(MyEventData<'a>) [guard1] = State2,
        State1 + Event2(&'a [u8]) [guard2] = State3,
    }
    // ...
}
```

See example `examples/event_with_data.rs` for a usage example.

### Guard and Action syntax

See example `examples/guard_action_syntax.rs` for a usage-example.

### Async Guard and Action

See example `examples/async.rs` for a usage-example.

## State Machine Examples

Here are some examples of state machines converted from UML to the State Machine Language DSL. Runnable versions of each example is available in the `examples` folder.
The `.png`s are generated with the `graphviz` feature.

### Linear state machine

![alt text](./docs/sm1.png "")

DSL implementation:

```rust
statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        *State1 + Event1 = State2,
        State2 + Event2 = State3,
    }
}
```

This example is available in `ex1.rs`.

### Looping state machine

![alt text](./docs/sm2.png "")

DSL implementation:

```rust
statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        *State1 + Event1 = State2,
        State2 + Event2 = State3,
        State3 + Event3 = State2,
    }
}
```

This example is available in `ex2.rs`.

### Using guards and actions

![alt text](./docs/sm3.png "")

DSL implementation:

```rust
statemachine!{
    transitions: {
        *State1 + Event1 [guard] / action = State2,
    }
}
```

This example is available in `ex3.rs`.

## Helpers

### Auto-derive certain traits for states and events

Setting `derive_events` and `derive_states` fields to an array of traits adds a derive expression to `Events` and `States` enums respectively. To derive Display, use `derive_more::Display`.


```rust
use core::Debug;
use derive_more::Display;
// ...
statemachine!{
    derive_states: [Debug, Display],
    derive_events: [Debug, Display],
    transitions: {
        *State1 + Event1 = State2,
    }
}

// ...

println!("Current state: {}", sm.state().unwrap());
println!("Expected state: {}", States::State1);
println!("Sending event: {}", Events::Event1);

// ...

```

### Hooks for logging events, guards, actions, and state transitions

The `StateMachineContext` trait defines (and provides default, no-op implementations for) functions that are called for each event, guard, action, and state transition. You can provide your
own implementations which plug into your preferred logging mechanism.

```rust
fn log_process_event(&self, current_state: &States, event: &Events) {}
fn log_guard(&self, guard: &'static str, result: &Result<(), ()>) {}
fn log_action(&self, action: &'static str) {}
fn log_state_change(&self, new_state: &States) {}
```

See `examples/state_machine_logger.rs` for an example which uses `derive_states` and `derive_events` to derive `Debug` implementations for easy logging.
